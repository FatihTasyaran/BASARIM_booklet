    Machine learning $(M L)$ application in diverse fields has been favored to elevate the performance of human endeavors due to its effectiveness in solving different types of real-world issues requiring intensive computation. In particle physics, the investigation of dimuons $\left(\mu^{+} \mu^{-}\right)$has an important role to understand various systems produced at high energy collisions. The absence of strong interaction makes these lepton pairs suitable to examine particles such as $J / \psi, \Upsilon$ and $Z$ boson. Dimuons can be identified by sophisticated techniques depending on cut-based methods as other particle analyses. In this contribution, the implementation of Random Forest and Weighted Random Forest ML models for defining dimuon pairs produced in proton-proton collisions at $7 \mathrm{TeV}$ at the LHC are discussed.
