    In this study, we examine if engineered topological features can distinguish time series sampled from different stochastic processes with different noise characteristics, in both balanced and unbalanced sampling schemes. We compare our classification results against the results of the same classification tasks built on statistical and raw features. We conclude that in classification tasks of time series, different machine learning mod- els built on engineered topological features perform consistently better than those built on standard statistical and raw features.
