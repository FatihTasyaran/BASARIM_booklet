The common use of hydrogen as a renewable energy source has been one of today's challenge which if solved can replace dependence on fossil fuels. One of the sustainable way of $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ production is photo-catalytic water reduction reaction catalyzed by molecules having transition metals as reaction centers. In this work, we theoretically investigate water reduction mechanism of planar Cobalt based catalyst by employing Ab-initio Molecular Dynamics (AIMD) and Metadynamics (MTD) simulations. We model the first electron injection intermediate step of the ECEC reaction mechanism of the water reduction reaction. We identify the solvent response following the electron injection.
