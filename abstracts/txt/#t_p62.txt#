A preliminary analysis have been implemented to distinguish good events in Monte Carlo (MC) data using image recognition tools. All images from MC simulations are created with DELPHES detector program with ATLAS detector card. The experimental dataset contains some of the signal events in three different forms: side front, and ηφ-plane. We increased the number of images to 600 with improving image resolution, and quality by utilizing Image Data Augmentation code from Keras (Python deep learning API). Furthermore, we utilized transfer learning from ImageNet database due to overfitting problems.
Different types of well-known models are employed for classification task such as VGG16, VGG19, Resnet 50, MobileNetv2 and Xception.
