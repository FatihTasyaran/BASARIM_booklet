In this work we simulated flow and mass transfer in virtual porous media for a liquid chromatography application. The three-dimensional geometry was formed by a diffusion-limited aggregation approach. The velocity field was obtained using the lattice Boltzmann methodology (LBM) via the PALABOS open-source library with modification. For mass transfer, a tracer-based random walk particle tracking (RWPT) model was used to obtain pulse simulation results.
